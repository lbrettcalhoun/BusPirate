Exploration of I2C read/write serial communication with 24LC08B EEPROM.  Yes, these programs are desperately in need of modularization (and use of a struct probably wouldn't hurt anything), but they were written as an I2C serial communications learning exercise and it was easier for me to lump everything into main.  Feel free to create your own fork and improve as necessary.
